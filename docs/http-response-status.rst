4xx client errors
-----------------

* ``400 Bad Request`` - the ohsome API cannot or will not process the request due to a client error (e.g. malformed request syntax)

5xx server errors
-----------------

* ``500 Internal Server Error``- generic error message, given when an unexpected condition in the ohsome API was encountered
* ``501 Not Implemented``	- the ohsome API either does not recognize the request method, or it lacks the ability to fulfil the request
